## Warm Up

Prompt:

## Review

* Reducers - A way to handle actions. Manipulating (reading / updating) the state.
* Actions - An Object produced by a helper function, has a `type` to tell the reducer which logic to run and pass in any appropriate data.
* Action Creator - a part of the reducer that creates the action.  supplies any values to the action passed into the reducer.

Categories and Products
* Reading from state in a Reducer.
  * Is each property in state a property something you defined? Yes (for now)
* `createStore` is deprecated and redux wants us to use something.
