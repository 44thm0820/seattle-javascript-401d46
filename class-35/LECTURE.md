# Class 35 - Graphs

## Technical Interview Debrief

### Takeaways

* Study you Data Structures!

* Good to work in other mediums.

* Nice write code in a google doc.

* Know your whiteboarding tool.

End of next week (8) I open up Whiteboarding final schedules.

## Overview

What are graphs? New Structure that uses a few other structures we've previously covered.

## Terminology

* Direction:  When an edge points from one node towards another.
* Nodes / Vertex: Our data storage container, has a value, no longer stores children.
* Edge: Connection between nodes.  Contains references between nodes.
* Degree: Property of a node, how many edges a node has.
* Acyclical / cyclical:  When a node points to back to another neighbor.
* Neighbors: What we now call nodes connected by an edge.
