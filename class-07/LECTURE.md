# Class 07: Bearer Authentication

## Warm Up

## Code Review

Micha: comparing our password hash, Frustrating!!

- Comments (too much clutter / hard to read)

Tanner:  Same thing, Comparison frustrating :/
Andres: Hard time finding direction!

- How to validate what we are doing is heading in the right direction.

Michael: ditto with the starting point.

- So much documentation, where do I begin?

## Json Web Tokens

- A temporary and completly client safe way of authenticating any request (as long as authorized)
  - Token is completely safe for interception
  - OUr server can validate the token with a API SECRET.
