# Class 41: React Native

## Announcements

Whiteboards are happening this week!

* Keep an eye in slack for messages from myself or another instructor.
* Everyone will at least get to round 1 this week.
* Round 2 will begin as soon as everyone has completed round 1.

## Warm Up

Prompt: Given a Binary Tree of integer values, write a function that can traverse the tree and return the most common value found in the tree.

What did we come up with?

* Traverse the tree.
* Use a Hashmap / object literal to store each value.
* Keep track of most common "bucket", and return the key with the largest value.

* Efficiency
time: O(2n) => O(n).
Space: O(n).

```javascript


function mostCommon(bt) {

}

```
