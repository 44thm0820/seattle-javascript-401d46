  * A place for javascript to run.
  * Parse and execute our JS.
    * V8 engine.
  * Responsible for providing tools and global variables that the code can "use".
  * `document.getElementById` - object that our runtime environment gives us.
  * `require()` - function that node provdes in our runtime environment.

Allows us to export and import "modules"
